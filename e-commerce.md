## User story

As a user, I want to be able to search for products on an e-commerce website, so that I can quickly find and purchase items I am interested in.

## Process description

**Objective**

The objective of this process is to provide users with a seamless experience when searching for products on the e-commerce website. This includes basic and advanced search functionalities, ensuring accurate results, and handling various scenarios effectively.

1. User Initiates Search

- Users access the search functionality on the website to find products.

2. Basic Search

- Users enter a valid search query (e.g., product name) and initiate the search.

3. Advanced Search:

- Users have the option to use advanced search filters (e.g., price range, brand) to refine their search.
  
4. System Processes Search:

- The system processes the search query, considering both basic and advanced criteria.
  
5. Search Results Display:

- The system displays relevant products matching the user's search query.
  
6. Empty Search Handling:

- If a user attempts to search without entering any query, the system prompts them to enter a search query.
  
7. Invalid Search Handling:

- If a user enters a non-existent product name or random characters, the system provides a message indicating that no matching products were found.
  
8. Advanced Filters Application:

- The system accurately applies advanced search filters, refining search results based on the specified criteria.
  
9. Boundary Testing:

- The system handles boundary scenarios, such as displaying the maximum number of products allowed per page.
  
10. Performance Testing:
    
- Performance tests measure the response time of the search functionality, ensuring results load within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., under 3 seconds).

11. Continuous Monitoring:

- Regular monitoring of the search functionality ensures ongoing performance and identifies any potential issues.
  
12. User Feedback and Iteration:

- User feedback, analytics, and monitoring results are used to iterate on the search functionality, addressing any issues and improving the user experience.
